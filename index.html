    <section id="about">
      <h2>About GuessGenie</h2>
      <p>My passion for merging game mechanics with engaging user experiences sparked the creation of GuessGenie. During a brainstorming session, I envisioned a platform that not only entertains but also challenges users on an intellectual level. GuessGenie embodies my personal exploration into the realm of interactive gaming and user engagement.</p>
      <p>The journey began in January 2024. Through iterative design and development phases, GuessGenie evolved into the polished and interactive experience you see today.</p>
      <p>GuessGenie serves as a portfolio project for Holberton School, demonstrating the practical application of the skills and knowledge acquired during the course. [Portfolio Project Link](#)</p>
